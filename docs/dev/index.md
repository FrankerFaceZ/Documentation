## Developers

Hey there! (Did we put the word Developers here enough for it to look fake yet?)

Our documentation website is very new, so there's not much here yet.

If you're looking for documentation on our API, you'll want to check here
for now: https://api.frankerfacez.com/docs/

If you want to start working on an OAuth application, ping `SirStendec` on
Discord for now and ask about getting a client set up. There's a website update
coming soon that'll let you create your own OAuth clients but it's not quite
ready due to other changes.

If you want more details on our link preview system, [head over here](link-preview/).

If you want more details on our Pub/Sub system for live updates, we do too. But
it's not ready yet. If you want updates, please [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/UrAkGhT). There'll be
an announcement when we have something.

If you want more details on our client architecture, we've started rewriting
the client in TypeScript and documenting that. Check out the
[Client Modules](client/modules) pages for that.

Your best bet to get started with add-on development is to check out the [commented
source code for the example add-on](https://github.com/FrankerFaceZ/Add-Ons/blob/master/src/example/index.js), and ask lots of questions in our development
channels. (Make sure to ask for the Developer role after joining our Discord!)
